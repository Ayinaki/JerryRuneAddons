Small mod to help reduce lag and stop game freezes,
Stops you from rending falling block entities to help with lag in skyblock (mainly phase 5 of m7 with the statues exploding and the dragon in the end spawning) 
Can be toggled with a keybind that you can set in Minecraft controls. 
Shouldn't break anything besides possibly midas staff and yeti sword.
